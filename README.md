# IoT-Project
This part of one school project made by me. In this project we use an Arduino ESP32. The ESP32 has 4 potentiometers. 
The ESP32 is connected to a Firebase Realtime Database where ir collect in real time the values of each potentiometer.
Finally I create a simple Web App which is connected to Firebase to get the last values of each potentiometer.
